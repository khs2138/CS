# Introduction to UNIX 

An **Operating System (OS)** is software that sits between hardware and other software. The core part of the OS is called the "kernel". Windows, Linux, and Mac OS are all examples of OS. 

What does the OS do? The OS is both a dictator and a servant. It controls hardware resources and logical resources. It provides a virtual environment in which programs run. It works on linear address space, has exclusive use of the CPU.

## The Stack 

Applications 
\---------------
Library Functions
\---------------
System Calls 
\---------------
OS Kernel
\---------------
Hardware

1. **Hardware** These are the physical components (processor, disk, keyboard)
2. **OS Kernel** The kernel is the core of an OS thast loads first, controls tesources, and performs fundamental tasks. 
3. **System calls** These are calls/requests for kernel operations. Includes open(), read(), fork(), signal(), exec().
4. **Library Functions** These are built in functions that come with programming languages and perform specific functions. Includes printf(), malloc(), strcpy(), fread(), fopen()
5. **Applications** These are the end-user programs like emacs, gcc, firefox, bash, and executables you build in class such as mdb-lookup. 

## User Permissions 

Unix systems have three different ways to allocate permissions:
> Owner, Group, Everyone else
> 
The owner can assign owner permissions to any user. the **root user** has all permissions by default.

There are three Unix file permissions:
> Read, Write, and Execute
> 
Permissions are represented as combinations of 3 binary digits. Each digit represents one of read, write, and execute. 
> 100 read - value of 4
> 110 read, write - value of 6
> 111 read, write, execute - value of 7
> 
The above can be combined in order of owner-group-other in a string such as "644" which would mean the owner can read/write, the group and others can both only read.

```c
// Set permissions for a path
chmod ### path
```
To display permissions:
```c
ls -al
```

## Processes and fork( )

A program is a package of insructions. Whereas a **process** is an instance of a program. A program can have multiple processes associated with it. For example, we can run multiple instances of an executable independently, thereby initating multiple processes that run that program. 

**process ID** - a unique, nonnegative numeric identifier associated with each process. 
>**getpid()** returns the process ID of the current process.
>**pid_t** is a typedef integer variable to represent the ID

To create a new process, we can call the fork system from an existing process. **fork()** creates a new process by duplicating the current process, and each process executes from the point of the fork() call. 

Fork duplicates the entire virtual address space when creating the new process. So it duplicates the stack, heap, the tasks etc. 

The caller of fork is the **parent process** and the process getting created is the **child process**. 

fork() returns 0 within the child process, and the process ID of the new child process in the parent process. 
> The process ID of the child process is positive. So if the return value is positive, you are the parent process.
> If it is 0, you are the child process.
> If it is a negative number, the fork failed.
> 
It is unpredictable which process will run first. The processes run independently. Both child and parent process can interact with each other. They do so with a file (read/write).

Forking is used to run other programs via an existing process (lab5). You'll have a running process that will fork itself and, wile the parent continues executing the original program instructions, the child will transform into another process. 
> This is what bash shell does - it duplicates into two, child process of bash turns into ls, for example. 

## exec() - How do we transform the child? 

The exec() family of functions can be used to transform your current process into an instance of another program. The new program is specified in the arguments to the exec() call. 

After the call to exec(), the process running exec() will cease to execute the code of its original proram and begin executing the code of the new program. The code, data, heap and stack are all replaced with those of the new program. 

If the program reaches its end, the process will exit and will never return to the code of the original program. This means that any code following exec() will only be executed if the call to exec() fails. 

## Fork/exec for the OS 

Forking and executing is how the entire OS works. The kernel starts an init process and everything is fork/exec'ed from there.
