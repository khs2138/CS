## fork( ) recap 
When fork() is called, you may have stack variables. This creates a new process that is duplicated (memory and all), and nothing is shared between them. Both processes will return from fork() and proceed from that point.

Since we know how to fork, and we will learn how to turn one process into another process by calling a function called execl, we can actually write a shell. 

Bash is a shell program.

## shell.c

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

static void die(const char *s)
{
    perror(s);
    exit(1);
}

int main()
{
    char        buf[100];
    pid_t       pid;
    int         status;

    printf("AP> ");

    while (fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin) != NULL) {

        if (buf[strlen(buf) - 1] == '\n')
            buf[strlen(buf) - 1] = 0; // replace newline with '\0'

        pid = fork();
        if (pid < 0) {
            die("fork error");
        } else if (pid == 0) {
            // child process
            execl(buf, buf, (char *)0);
            die("execl failed");
        } else {
            // parent process
            if (waitpid(pid, &status, 0) != pid)
                die("waitpid failed");
        }

        printf("AP> ");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**waitpid( )** ensures that a process will "wait" until the process referenced by the inputted pid terminates. This is part of a family of wait functions.

We wil use **execl( )** which is part of the exec family of functions. 

Running through shell.c:

> Run fgets() and replace a new line character with null character
> 
> pid is set as the ID of the child process that is created. Return the error that fork failed if pid is negative. Otherwise, we're going to transform the child process.
> > Both the parent and child process will run from the point of wear fork is called. 
> > 
> > You can identify which process you are in by checking the pid, and deciding what to do based on that. 
> 
> Child process execl: 
> > If we are in the child process, the return value is 0, we call execl. See below for execl details.
>
> Parent process waitpid:
> > If we are in the parent process (pid is not 0 or negative), we handle the **unpredictability of the order of execution relative to the child and parent, i.e. which "goes first"** by calling waitpid(pid...) See details of waitpid( ) below


## execl( )

execl() completely replaces the child process image with the new one - an instance of the program passed through buf. 

The first argument of exec() family of functions is the path of the file to be executed. 

The second argument is the filename of the file to be executed (this is why buf is passed twice).

Subsequent arguments are arguments to pass into the file to be executed. The list of parameters must always be ended by NULL pointer cast to char * to show the end of the argument list. 
> Essentially, the second argument is the argv array. So it is the name of the executable file with 0 or more input arguments. For any program where argc = 1 (only the name of the executable), there will only be 3 arguments passed to execl. 

shell.c does not pass any arguments, so it is just buf twice and then (char * )0.

Once execl( ) is executed, if it succeeded, no code below line 32 will execute. Hence why line 33 sends an error that execl failed because if line 33 is reached, it must have failed.

## waitpid( )

waitpid( ) is used to handle the unpredictability of the order of execution of parent/child processes. It is used to wait or check for state changes in child processes from within the parent process. 

```c
pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options);
```
The first argument is the pid of a specific child process. 

The second argument is a pointer to status, telling waitpid( ) to save state information in that variable. State information could be signals set int he process, exits, and terminations or errors. 

The third argument is an option parameter. 0 tells the function to put off returning until child process or processes have changed state or temrinated. 

In shell.c, it returns the process ID of the child it waited for. 



### IN CLASS 03/12, original notes(repetitive of above)

Bash - shell program

```c
~/cs3157-pub/sample-code
gcc shell.c
//
./a.out
// AP > 
AP> ls 
// does not work
AP> /bin/ls // works 
AP> /usr/bin/cal //works 
AP> /usr/games/sl //works 


```

```c
while(fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin) != NULL){

}
```
**execl**
fork - parent and child process

pid = process ID of newly created child process
fork returns 0 in child process to indicate child prpocess
-1 reutrn would indicate error 

if fork retuns 0, you know you're in child process - this funciton execl takes a variable number of arguments and the very first argument is a string (buf) 

very first arg is program that youw ant to repalce that process with 

When you call execl in pogram, your curren tprogram stops running completely, your code is gutted out and you replace the whole thing with a brand new program, reinitialize stack heap static etc as if running program for first time but within context of current process (pid) remains the same. 

Code that you're running will cease to exist, OS loads brand new code and starts executing main of that program

rest of arguments is argv array, command line arguments 

last arg is char* null pointer, tha'ts how execl knows when the argument has ended (bc varialble length args like rpintf)

if you actually got to line 33, execl has failed 

waitpid - passes id of child process 

waitpid functipn will wait until child process terminates and only then it will return the pid that we passed in, and if that's not the case, it failed

call waitpid with a pointer
